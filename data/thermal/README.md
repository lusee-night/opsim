# Thermal Data

This folder is used to keep temperature-related data. Currently it contains
the original Diviner curve used in legacy notebooks, and an updated version
based on the Lander position:

* `Landing_Site_Temperatures_from_Diviner.txt` : _updated_
* `lunarTemperature30degDiviner.txt` : _original_

Note that the copy of this data is *hardcoded* as the Lunar surface temperature in Sun object in coordinates.py.
