# Utility scripts for the "OpSim" project

## Main script

* `prep-sun` -- pre-calculation of the Sun's trajectory in the sky, to facilitate power and other calculations; saved to a cache file

## Deferred

* `prep-sun` -- kept for future development, if more time series need to be added to the cache

## Deprected

* `prep-power` -- pre-calculation of the power output of the solar panels; functionality moved elsewhere
