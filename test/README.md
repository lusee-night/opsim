# Test scripts

This folder is the place for testing scripts including CI. For the purposes of CI,
the scripts contain the previously recorded "reference data" as hardcoded arrays.
The return code is zero if the outputs produces in the given run are within certain
tolerance limit defined in the code, from the reference values.
